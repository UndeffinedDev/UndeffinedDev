## About Me

I’m Sergio Caguana, a software developer passionate about creating clean, efficient, and innovative solutions. I work under the alias **UndeffinedDev**, and my work spans multiple domains such as Python applications, Minecraft plugins, and web technologies. My goal is to push the boundaries of what’s possible while maintaining simplicity and elegance in design.

***Interesting but unnecessary fact***: I prefer modern and minimalist designs using simple color schemes, primarily white, gray, and black.
